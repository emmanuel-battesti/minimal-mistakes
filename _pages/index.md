## Welcome to *Swarm-Rescue*

With this project, you will try to save human lives, in simulation... Teach a swarm of drones how to behave to save a maximum of injured people in a minimum of time !

Your job will be to propose your own version of the controller of the drone. In a competition, each participating team will perform on a new unknown map, the winner will be the one who gets the most points based on several criteria: speed, quality of exploration, number of injured people saved, number of drones returned, etc.

*Swarm-Rescue* is the environment that simulates the drones and that describes the maps used, the drones and the different elements of the map.
